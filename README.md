# Shape Simulator â€“ Java Console Application ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Shape Simulator is a Java-based console application that allows users to calculate the **area**, **perimeter**, **surface area**, and **volume** of different 2D and 3D shapes interactively. The project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
| OOP Principle     | How It's Used                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Abstraction       | Interfaces `Shape`, `TwoDShape`, `ThreeDShape` |
| Inheritance       | Shape types inherit shared behaviors         |
| Polymorphism      | Methods operate on parent interfaces         |
| Encapsulation     | Logic confined inside each class             |
